## Python Static Files

***

Use Python's built-in SimpleHTTPServer to serve static files

If you have Python and a shell, this gets you a web server:

***

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
``` 

### Advantages:

 * Load resources the same way as a production server, GitHub Pages, etc.

### Disadvantages:

 * No livereload, minification, test runners
