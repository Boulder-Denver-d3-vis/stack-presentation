## Result of Stack

***

Our data has been annotated with `y0` values representing the baseline for each part of the stack.

Since the baseline depends on the sum of values from previous categories, the baseline is calculated *across* your sets.

If the first apples value is 5, the first oranges baseline should be 5.
